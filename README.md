# Python for Data Analysis - Study Notes (English/Vietnamese)

## Introduction
This repository contains my study notes for "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney. These notes serve as a bilingual reference with Vietnamese translations of key concepts from the book, focusing on practical Python programming for data analysis.

## About the Book
"Python for Data Analysis" is a comprehensive guide to using Python for data manipulation, processing, cleaning, and analysis. Written by Wes McKinney (the creator of pandas), this book is essential reading for anyone working with data in Python.

## Purpose of These Notes
- Provide Vietnamese translations and explanations of Python data concepts
- Create a bilingual (English/Vietnamese) learning resource
- Summarize key programming techniques for data analysis
- Create a shareable reference for Vietnamese speakers learning Python for data analysis
- Document code examples and their outputs

## Contents
These notes cover:
- Python data structures (tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Functions and functional programming
- File handling and I/O operations
- NumPy basics
- pandas fundamentals
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data visualization

## How to Use
Each Jupyter notebook contains explanations, code examples, and outputs. The notebooks are organized by chapter, following the structure of the book.

## Status
This is an ongoing project as I work through the book. Notes will be updated regularly.
