# Python for Data Analysis â€“ Bilingual Study Notes (English & Vietnamese)

## Introduction
This repository contains my bilingual study notes for *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney. The notes include Vietnamese translations of key concepts and practical Python programming techniques for data analysis.

## About the Book
"Python for Data Analysis" is a comprehensive guide to using Python for data manipulation, processing, cleaning, and analysis. Written by Wes McKinney (the creator of pandas), this book is essential reading for anyone working with data in Python.

## Purpose of These Notes
- Provide Vietnamese translations and explanations of Python data concepts
- Create a bilingual (English/Vietnamese) learning resource
- Summarize key programming techniques for data analysis
- Create a shareable reference for Vietnamese speakers learning Python for data analysis
- Document code examples and their outputs

## Contents
These notes cover:
- Python data structures (tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Functions and functional programming
- File handling and I/O operations
- NumPy basics
- pandas fundamentals
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data visualization

## How to Use
Each Jupyter notebook contains explanations, code examples, and outputs. The notebooks are organized by chapter, following the structure of the book.

# Data Examples

The examples in this repository use datasets from the original "Python for Data Analysis" book.

## How to get the data:
1. Visit the official repository: https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
2. Download or clone the repository
3. Copy the necessary data files to this directory

**Note**: The datasets are not included in this repository to respect copyright. Please refer to the original source.

## Status
This is an ongoing project. I will continue updating the notes as I progress through the book.

## Disclaimer
These notes are personal study materials and not intended as a replacement for the original book. I highly recommend purchasing the official book to support the author and get the complete knowledge.

This project consists of my personal notes and Vietnamese translations of concepts from the book. All code examples are based on exercises from the book with my own comments and explanations.
